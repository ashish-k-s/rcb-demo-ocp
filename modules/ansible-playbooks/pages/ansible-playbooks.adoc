#  Ansible Playbooks

Ansible Playbooks are user-friendly, simple-to-understand files written in YAML format that define automation tasks. They serve as instructions for Ansible to configure systems and manage their state. Key components of playbooks include:

- **Tasks**: Individual actions to be executed on managed nodes.
- **Roles**: Logical collections of tasks, variables, files, and templates for organizing playbooks.
- **Variables**: Dynamic values that can change during runtime, enabling reusability and flexibility.
- **Templates**: Placeholders for creating configuration files, allowing dynamic content insertion.

Playbooks facilitate system administration by automating repetitive tasks, ensuring consistency, and reducing human error. They promote infrastructure as code (IaC) principles, enabling version control and collaboration in managing system configurations.
