#  Introduction to container orchestration and its benefits

- Container orchestration is a key practice in managing containerized applications, automating their deployment, scaling, and maintenance.
- It offers significant benefits such as enhanced resource utilization, streamlined application management, and improved system resilience.
- Two prominent tools in this domain are Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift, both designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts.
- Kubernetes is an open-source platform originally developed by Google, while Red Hat OpenShift is an enterprise Kubernetes distribution that adds additional proprietary features and support from Red Hat.
- This introduction will outline these platforms' roles in container orchestration, focusing on their architecture and the advantages they bring to modern application deployment and management.
