#  Introduction to Ansible

- **Introduction to Ansible**
  - Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment.
  - It employs a simple, human-readable language (YAML) to define system configurations, making it accessible for users without deep programming skills.
  - Ansible follows a client-server architecture where the control node (Ansible control machine) manages the inventory of managed nodes (servers or workstations to be automated).
  - The communication between components occurs over SSH (Secure Shell), ensuring secure and reliable data transfer.
  - Key use cases include automating repetitive tasks, managing system configurations, and deploying applications across various environments.
  - This introductory section covers the fundamentals of Ansible, setting the stage for deeper exploration into its architecture, playbooks, and hands-on implementation in subsequent modules.
